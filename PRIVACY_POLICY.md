**Last updated:** [INSERT TODAY’S DATE, Eg: May 24, 2024]

Thank you for using the “Ways” mobile app. This privacy policy explains how your information is processed when you use our app.

## Information We Collect

The Ways app is designed with your privacy in mind. The app allows you to create, save, and manage mind maps and project data. This data includes:

* Project names

All of this data you create is **only** stored locally on your device. We use a local database technology (Hive) to save your projects directly to your phone or tablet.

## How We Use Your Information

The data you create is used only for the core functionality of the app — to save and load your mind maps for you to access later.

**We do not collect, transfer or store any of your personal information or project data on external servers.** Your data remains on your device unless you manually export or share it.

## Third Party Services

The Ways app does not use any third party services that may collect information from you.
